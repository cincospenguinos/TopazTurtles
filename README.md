# NLP Project -- Topaz Turtles

Here's the parts we will need:

- [ ] Something that grabs the correct answers from the gold standard answers
- [ ] Something that extracts features from a text and outputs it in a format 
      that a machine learning library can handle
- [ ] A Main class that takes the proper input and kicks off everything
- [ ] PoS tagger and other lower level NLP tools
- [ ] A Named Entity Recognizer of some sort (trust me, this will help enormously)
- [ ] Machine Learning library of some sort, preferably through Java
